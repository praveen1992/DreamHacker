This setup takes data from pulse sensor and time of the day etc, to predict when the person has slept.
Then after a while start the audio stimulus.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Clone the repository

### Installation
Hardware
```
 - Set up the circuit as shown in the diagram.
 - Put a speaker with it's audio jack in the audio output of the raspberry pi.
```

Software
```
1. Use SSH, VNC or a monitor and a keyboard to login to raspberry pi.
2. Clone the repository somewhere in the Raspberry Pi.
3. Run the following commands from inside the repository 
 - `cmake .` 
 - `make`
```

### Usage
- Put your audio files inside the directory Audio/.
- Edit the audio.txt file with the name of the audio you want to play when the sleep starts. For example if you want to play `my_file.mp3` present in the Audio/ directory then write `Audio/my_file.mp3`. Make sure that the file has just one line.
- If you want to run a simulation to test out the setup run the main function with 1 as the argument. `./main 1`. If you want to run the full program just run `./main`
